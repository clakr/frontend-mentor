## Process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
  - Grid
  - Flexbox
- TailwindCSS
  - extends
  - plugins
  - `group` & `group-active:`

### Thoughts

Not much into thoughts of designing the component itself, but the "how" of extending the existing color palette of TailwindCSS through the `tailwind.config.js`, `extends`, and `plugins` is what I want to learn for this project.

If I were to improve this solution, it would be through creating of pseudo elements instead of creating another element for the active state of the image.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - `tailwind.config.js`, `extends` & `plugins`
