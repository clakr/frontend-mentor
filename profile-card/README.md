## Process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
  - `normalize.css`
  - `display: flex` & `display: grid`
  - Variables

### Thoughts

Not much complexity layout-wise, as the card's layout is the same from mobile to desktop media queries.

Just had trouble with how the `background-image` size is scaling up in size therefore intersecting, which I think is not intended. Currently looking into `min()`, `max()`, `minmax()` & `clamp()`.
