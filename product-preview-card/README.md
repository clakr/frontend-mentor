## Process

### Built with

  - Pseudo-class selectors
  - Variables
  - Media Queries
- SASS
  - Variables
  - `@mixin` & `@include` 
  - Media Queries

### Thoughts

Just like what I did in my [last solution](https://clakr.github.io/frontend-mentor/qr-code-component-main/), I started from using Mobile-first principle and work the component up, adjusting elements according to the design. Since Media Queries played a big role in this challenge, I integrated [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) into the project just to feel out how easy SASS' syntax is in writing CSS.
